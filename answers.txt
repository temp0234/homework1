What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

"git merge" merges two separate branches into a single branch. 
It preserves the separate history of each branch.
"git rebase" is similar in that it merges two branches, but it also makes one of
the branch's history the single history of both branches.

What is a remote repository?

A remote repository is a repo that several people can collaborate on, because
it's hosted remotely rather than locally on any one person's machine.
